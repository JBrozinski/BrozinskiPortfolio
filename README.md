Portfolio

Joe Brozinski

DU Full Stack Coding BootCamp 2020


This portfolio is meant to display my front end skills as well as some of the projects I have worked on in class. I used a bootstrap theme under the MIT license to ensure quality design, UX/UI, and functonality, then customized it for my specific needs. The portfolio section of the page links to three projects; the Gem Game, the Train Schedule, The Clicky Game, Mongo Webscraper, and the  Underground Movie Bunker. I have also included links to my GitHub, and LinkedIn accounts as well as my contact information and a copy of my resume.
